WP E-commerce Expanding Categories converts the WP e-commerce categories widget into a collapsible menu

== Description ==

By default, the categories widget in WP E-commerce is fully expanded. If you have a large number of categories and subcategories this can be a bit too much. The WP E-commerce Expanding Categories plugin wraps the code that is discussed at http://ken.ph/wp-e-commerce-expandablecollapsible-menu/ in a WordPress plugin so that no editing of the theme is necessary, and turns the categories widget into an expandable/collapsible menu.

== Installation ==

1. Download `wp-e-commerce-expanding-categories.zip` from the Wordpress repository
2. Unzip the file
3. Upload the unzipped directory `wp-e-commerce-expanding-categories` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
5. That's it. There are no options
